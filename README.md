# XR Audio School - Prototype
Learn audio skills through an exciting and imaginative simulation in Mixed Reality!
I worked with Meta SDK version 64  -- espeically the Mixed Reality Utility Kit (MRUK).
The environment in this scene uses the SDK's "Scene Understanding" and "Room Model" features. This means, the room geometry shown is an overlay of my actual room layout and furniture. It will be unique for every user in their different spaces.
Future versions would allow a user to operate the scene with full passthrough seeing their own room.
